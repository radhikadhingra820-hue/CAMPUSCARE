# CAMPUSCARE — Intelligent Complaint Triage

CAMPUSCARE is a Django-based smart campus complaint portal that uses machine learning and text similarity to analyze student complaints.

## Live Demo

🌐 **[Open CAMPUSCARE](https://campuscare-025j.onrender.com)**

## Current Prototype

Students can:
- Submit a campus complaint
- Get an automatically predicted complaint category
- Get a priority level
- See the department routed for the complaint
- Get a duplicate/similar-complaint warning

Complaints are stored in SQLite for local development and PostgreSQL when deployed with the included Render blueprint.

## How It Works

```text

TF-IDF Text Features

SQLite Database
```

## Categories

- IT & Wi-Fi
- Hostel
- Academic
- Infrastructure
- Transport

## Technology

Python, Django, Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, TF-IDF, Logistic Regression, HTML/CSS, SQLite and GitHub.

## Dataset

The repository includes a 400-row synthetic campus complaint dataset in `data/complaints.csv`.

The dataset is provided for development and competition purposes. It is synthetic and should not be treated as real student feedback.

## Run Locally

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/radhikadhingra820-hue/CAMPUSCARE.git
cd CAMPUSCARE
```

### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment

Windows:

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

macOS/Linux:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Apply migrations

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

### 5. Start the server

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

## Deploy on Render

The repository includes `build.sh` and `render.yaml` for a Render deployment. The blueprint provisions a PostgreSQL database, installs production dependencies, collects static files, runs migrations, and starts Django with Gunicorn.

In Render, create a new Blueprint Instance from this repository and apply the included `render.yaml`. Render's documentation describes this Blueprint workflow for Django deployments. The deployed service will receive a generated `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY` and `DJANGO_DEBUG=false`.

## Competition Task

This repository intentionally provides a working prototype rather than a finished product.

Participants can extend CAMPUSCARE by improving the areas described in the repository Issues.

Examples include an admin dashboard, stronger complaint intelligence, and multilingual complaint handling.

## Testing

Run:

```bash
python manage.py test
```

The included tests cover core complaint creation and basic ML predictions.

## Note

CAMPUSCARE is a competition prototype. The included Django development configuration and SQLite database are intended for local development and experimentation, not production deployment.
